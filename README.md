You wake up on the ground, dazed and confused. Your name, face, origins have all been lost. You look all around to see trees and mountains with a small glimpse of a lake on your right side. However, something is strange. The mountains look weird. There is no grass on the floor. There are weird spinning gold discs in front of you. On the top left of your sight it reads: "Collect the Coins and Make it towards the Goal!". No matter which way you look, those words do not move from out of your sight. You decide to follow the words and explore the world in order to find out what is happening and who you are.
